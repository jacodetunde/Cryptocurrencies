# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investors.

The project involves using pandas to clean and preprocess the data so as to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for this analysis, it has been decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, it was decided to use clustering algorithm, then use data visualizations to share findings with the investors
